This project is about dhcp and remote booting.
Your dhcp server is jaguar. You will examine the setup of the dhcp server on jaguar for this project.
Be careful that the submit answers to the questions are correct for the machine you administer.
Examine the dhcpd.conf file and answer the following questions. What file does your machine use to
boot? What domain name server does your machine use? Give the lines that set the subnet, netmask and
router for your machine. Give the lines that set the name and IP address of your machine.



Search the rc.d directory. Which file starts dhcp?



The file from the previous questions also starts the trivial file transfer protocol server. It is started with an
option, what does that option mean?



Examine the in.tftpd process on jaguar. What option is it running with? What does that option mean?



Examine the in.tftpd entry in inetd.conf. What options does it start in.tftpd with? What do these
option mean?



Which is more secure, the inetd.conf or the way the instructor actually started it? (This is what happens
when you get in a hurry.)



Examine the default config file pxelinux.cfg. How many boot options are there? (Hint: Did you see
boot options when you did the install.)



Examine the default.std config file pxelinux.cfg (this file is not used). How many boot options are
there? Which kernels can be booted? Which message files can be displayed?
