This project is about dhcp and remote booting.
Your dhcp server is jaguar. You will examine the setup of the dhcp server on jaguar for this project.
Be careful that the submit answers to the questions are correct for the machine you administer.
Examine the dhcpd.conf file and answer the following questions.

What file does your machine use to boot?

filename "/tftpboot/pxelinux.0";

What domain name server does your machine use? Give the lines that set the subnet, netmask and
router for your machine. Give the lines that set the name and IP address of your machine.

option domain-name "net.cecs.csulb.edu";
option domain-name-servers 134.139.248.2;


  host lab68 {
    #hardware ethernet 00:11:11:92:09:db ;
    hardware ethernet 00:22:4d:4c:79:03 ;
    fixed-address 134.139.248.68 ;
  }

Search the rc.d directory. Which file starts dhcp?

/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1

The file from the previous questions also starts the trivial file transfer protocol server. It is started with an
option, what does that option mean?



Examine the in.tftpd process on jaguar. What option is it running with? What does that option mean?

 1923 ?        Ss     0:00 /usr/sbin/in.tftpd -l

       -l, --listen
              Run the server in standalone (listen) mode, rather than run from inetd.  In listen mode, the  --timeout  option
              is ignored, and the --address option can be used to specify a specific local address or port to listen to.

Examine the in.tftpd entry in inetd.conf. What options does it start in.tftpd with? What do these
option mean?

# tftp  dgram   udp     wait    root    /usr/sbin/in.tftpd  in.tftpd -s /tftpboot -r blksize

       --secure, -s
              Change root directory on startup.  This means the remote host does not need to pass along the directory as part
              of the transfer, and may add security.  When --secure is specified, exactly one directory should  be  specified
              on  the  command  line.   The use of this option is recommended for security as well as compatibility with some
              boot ROMs which cannot be easily made to include a directory name in its request.


Which is more secure, the inetd.conf or the way the instructor actually started it? (This is what happens
when you get in a hurry.)

The way inetd.conf is more secure because -l ignores the timeout option and that could be a secuirty vulnerability. (Workstation attack)

Examine the default config file pxelinux.cfg. How many boot options are there? (Hint: Did you see
boot options when you did the install.)

prompt=0
label linux
 kernel bzImage
 append initrd=initrd.img load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=0 rw SLACK_KERNEL=huge.s
4 options.

Examine the default.std config file pxelinux.cfg (this file is not used). How many boot options are
there? Which kernels can be booted? Which message files can be displayed?

default hugesmp.s
prompt 1
timeout 1200
display message.txt
F1 message.txt
F2 f2.txt
label huge.s
  kernel kernels/huge.s/bzImage
  append initrd=initrd.img load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=0 rw SLACK_KERNEL=huge.s
label hugesmp.s
  kernel kernels/hugesmp.s/bzImage
  append initrd=initrd.img load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=0 rw SLACK_KERNEL=hugesmp.s
label speakup.s
  kernel kernels/speakup.s/bzImage
  append initrd=initrd.img load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=0 rw SLACK_KERNEL=speakup.s
