This project is about disk quotas.
On the machine you administer.
Set up user quotas (version 2) on your hard drive. Specifically, set up only user quotas; do not set up group
qoutas.
Give bob a quota of one megabyte (1024 blocks) of disk space.
Do not put any limit on his quota of inodes.
Testing: as bob, try to copy in ~djv/etherboot.img. (There is nothing special about this file, it's just a
big file that is also used for something else.) You should get a "Disk quota exceeded message".
Report:
1) A summary of the steps you took to set up quotas. That is, what commands did you issue and in what
order.

quotacheck -a -m
equota -u bob

2) The modified line from fstab.

/dev/sda1        /                ext2        usrquota         1   1

3) The quota entry for bob as displayed by edquota.

                                          Disk quotas for user bob (uid 13101):
  Filesystem                   blocks       soft       hard     inodes     soft     hard

4) The size of the etherboot.img file in ~djv and the size of the etherboot.img in ~bob.

Quota (quotaon -a):
bob@lab68:~> cp ~djv/etherboot.img .
cp: writing `./etherboot.img': Disk quota exceeded
cp: failed to extend `./etherboot.img': Disk quota exceeded

-rw-r--r-- 1 bob  wheel 937984 Apr 30 19:11 etherboot.img

No quota (quotaoff -a):
-rw-r--r-- 1 bob  wheel 1474560 Apr 30 19:13 etherboot.img
