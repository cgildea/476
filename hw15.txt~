This project is about ftp.
1) On you local machine, check your ftpusers and proftpd.conf files to make sure that both network
(NIS/yp) accounts and anonymous ftp are allowed.
2) Log into jaguar. Ftp to your local machine. Use the username anonymous. Get the dummy test file. (If
you don’t have a dummy test file under ~ftp, make one up.)
Report: The ftp command used, and what it says when you login.
3) Modify the anonymous account so it will put up a greeting message when at the start of an anonmyous
ftp.
Test: go back to jaguar, ftp to anonymous on your machine and make sure you see the message.
Report: what changes did you make (give file names too).
4) Go back to jaguar. Ftp to your local machine. Use the username bob. Get the demo file. (If you didn’t
remember to make a demo file when you created bob, login as bob and create a text file called demo.)
Report: The commands used.
5) Change the settings on ftp so that bob may not use ftp. All other ftp capabilities should still be allowed.
Note: several other users are usually not allowed to use ftp, including root, uucp news; do not change
these permissions.
Test: make sure that bob cannot use ftp into your machine and your account can.
Report: Exactly what change you made and to what file/directory you made that change.
6) Dynamically and statically loaded libraries. Compare the clogitA and clogitB commands found in
~djv. Examine the size of the two commands and use ldd to look at the dynamically loaded libraries.
Report: the difference between the two commands (sizes and dynamic libraries).
