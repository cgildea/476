Situation:
We have installed new cabling in the lab.
We have had to redivide and reorganize the network.
Your machine will receive a new internet name and number.

Purpose:
Get you machine back on to the network.

Restriction:
This assignment must be done on Wednesday 3 April
(We've got to roll the entire set of cable at once.)
On that day at the start of lab, I will remove the
old network cables from your machine.

On the top of your machine will be a note
with the new name, IP number and
gateway for your machine.
(Netmasks are not changing.)

As root do the following.

1) Change the hostname in {\ltt{}/etc/HOSTNAME}

2) Change the IP number and gateway in {\ltt{}/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1}.

3) Plug the RJ network cable into the back of your machine.

4) Reboot.

If something goes wrong, it was your edit at  steps 1 or 2,
login as root and fix it, reboot.

Submission: None
