This project is about rdist.

You will use rdist to install a file from {\ltt{}jaguar} to the machine 
you administer.

A) On the machine you administer, if you didn't include rdist in your reload,
mount the cd from {\ltt{}jaguar} and install the rdist capabilities.

B) Create a file called {\ltt{}junk} in your home directory ({\ltt{}~css476x4}).
Put some ASCII message in this file like ``Hello".
This is the file to be distributed from {\ltt{}jaguar} to your machine.

C) Set up an rdist command file that does the following:

1) copies the file onto your machine as {\ltt{}/tmp/junk}

2) changes the mode on that file to be {\ltt{}755}

D) Set the machine you administer so that the {\ltt{}bob} account on that
machine (or whatever account you created) will accept rdist from your
class account on {\ltt{}jaguar}.

E) login to {\ltt{}jaguar} (using your class account).
Run the rdist command.

Check on the machine you administer to make sure the junk file appeared
and has the right mod.

Submit: what exactly did you do at step (D),
a copy of your rdist command file and
the exact form of the rdist command you used.
\bye
