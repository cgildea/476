This assignment covers SUID programs.

As bob: get a copy of {\ltt{}clogit.c} and compile it.
Name the compiled version {\ltt{}clogit}.
Don't forget to look at it to see what it does.
Create a file called {\ltt{}datelog} to be mode 600 and
change the {\ltt{}clogit} command to be SUID and executable
by everyone (mode 4711).

Login as your cav476xx account: run clogit.

1) Report: the last two lines in the datelog

Verify security: try doing the same thing by creating a shell script that
writes to the file using "echo" commands. (Don't be particular about
the exact things you echo.)
Make the shell script SUID.

Login as your cav476xx account: run the shell script.

2) Report: what happens.

Reminder: you should NEVER login as root while doing this project.
