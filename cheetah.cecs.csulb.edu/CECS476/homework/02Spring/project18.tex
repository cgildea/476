This project is about ftp.

1) Log into jaguar.
Ftp to your local machine.
Use the username anonymous.
Get the dummy test file.

Report: On login. It says "Welcome,...";
report the next two words after welcome.

2) Compare the {\ltt{}ls} command that everyone else uses with the
one for anonymous ftp.
Examine the size of the two ls command
and use {\ltt{}ldd} to look at the dynamically loaded libraries.

Report: the difference between the two commands (sizes and dynamic libraries).

3) The current setup of ftp is a little less secure than it
could be.
Some change would make it more secure.
Make these changes.
Then check your changes by logging log into jaguar a second time
and using anonymous ftp to get the dummy test file again.

Report: What changes you made.
If a change was made in a file, report the name of the file and
the result of your changed.
If you changed ownership or protection, report the new owner or mode.
