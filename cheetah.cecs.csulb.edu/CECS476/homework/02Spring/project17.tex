Suddenly, the machine which your group is assigned to administer,
contains an empty hard drive.
(Warning: machines will sudden loose their Unix as the appropriate
administrative teams arrive at this project.
When your team is ready, let me know so I can clean your machine's disk.)

Configure the machine according to the attached page (carefully).
If you don't include the correct software, later projects won't work..
If you botch the network configuration, your home directories won't
be available.

The root password should be set to the same word as before.

Once you have configured the system, create one local user (called bob).
Don't forget his home.

Report: Boot from the hard drive.
One of you should login with your csv476xx account, run df, 
report the amount disk free on your local drive.
This report (in addition to the one line df) should contain your machine
name and the names of all the members of the group.

When your written report is ready,
tell the instructor the system is up,
he will ask you to demo by first logining as bob, and second as
you (csv476xx) and do a couple {\ltt{}ls} commands.
If the logins and the {\ltt{}ls} commands work he will accept your report.
\bye
