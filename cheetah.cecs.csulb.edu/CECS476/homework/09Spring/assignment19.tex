This project is about configuring mail.

1) As {\ltt{}bob} modify your incoming mail handling as follows:

a) If the Subject line contains the word ``Late",
place the mail in a file called {\ltt{}latestuff}.

b) If it is from {\ltt{}csa476xx} (use your account here)
place the mail in a file called {\ltt{}importantstuff}

c) If the body of the mail contains the word {\ltt{}Bargin}
place the mail in a file called {\ltt{}junkmail}

If an incoming mail matches multiple actions, the first actions
specified should be taken.
Use lockfiles in all cases.

Report: the contents of bob's {\ltt{}.procmailrc}

For the remaining questions, examine the {\ltt{}sendmail.cf}
file on {\ltt{}panther}.

2) sendmail is set to forward to a smart host.
Report: the line in the {\ltt{}cf} that does this.

3) mail for {\ltt{}bob} and {\ltt{}root} is to be delivered locally and
not to the smart host.
Report: the line in the {\ltt{}cf} that does this.

4) Report the number of the ruleset that converts header
names to a masqueraded form.
