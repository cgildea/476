Report 1) what are the different mouse protocols available and 
2) what device does your config specify for the mouse and
3) 2hat device does {\ltt{}/dev/mouse} link to?

On your system probe your X11 setup (use a command, don't use
the files).

4) The exact command you ran.
5) The version of the X11 system on your machine and its release date.
6) The ``Vendor" of your video card.
7) The "Total memory:" that was found on your card.
8) What ``product" of that vendor was your card.
9) How many video modes were searched for a match.

Re-do your X11 configuration file.
You know your video card (from above).
Assume your monitor can do a standard SVGA (800x600), 30-50K horizontal,
40-90 vertical.
See if you can get at least two working resolutions.

Try starting X and stepping through some modes. Pick your
best mode and try using {\ltt{}xvidtune} on it.

Report: 10) the eleven numbers from the tuning program.
