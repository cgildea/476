This assignment covers SUID programs.

WARNING: You should NEVER login as root while doing this project.

You must pay particular attention to which user you are when
doing the parts of this project. Be sure you are the user
you are instructed to be at each step of the project.

As bob: get a copy of {\ltt{}~djv/clogit.c} and compile it.
Name the compiled version {\ltt{}clogit}.
Don't forget to look at it to see what it does.
Create a file called {\ltt{}datelog} to be mode 600 and
change the {\ltt{}clogit} command to be SUID and executable
by everyone (mode 4711).

Login as your csc476xx account: run clogit.

1) Report: the last two lines in the datelog

Verify security: try doing the same thing by creating (as bob) a shell
script that writes to the file using "echo" commands.
(Don't be particular about the exact things you echo.)
Make the shell script SUID.

Login as your csc476xx account: run the shell script.

2) Report: what happens.
\bye
