This assignment covers the X Window system.

On your machine examine the x configuration file.
Report 1) what are the different mouse protocols available and 
2) what device does your config specify for the mouse.
Examine that device (this means examine {\ltt{}/dev} and
note what the mouse device is pointing to)
and report 3) exactly what is that device is.

Check the configuration of your X system (using a command, not using
the files).
Report
4) the exact command you ran,
5) the version of the X11 system on your machine and its release date,
6) the "Total memory:" that was found,
7) how many video modes were examined,
8) who was the ``vendor" of your video card,
and 
9) what ``product" of that vendor was your card

Re-do your X11 configuration file.
You know your video card (from above).
Assume your monitor can do a standard SVGA (800x600), 30-50K horizontal,
40-90 vertical.
See if you can get at least two working resolutions.

Try starting X and stepping through some modes. Pick your
best mode and tune it.

Report: 10) the exact numbers from the tuning program.
