Suddenly, the machine which you are assigned to administer,
contains an empty hard drive.
(When your are ready to do this project,
let me know so I can clean your machine's hard drive.)

Configure the machine according to the attached page (carefully).
If you don't include the correct software, later projects won't work..
If you botch the network configuration, your home directories won't
be available.

The root password should be set to the same word as before.

Once you have configured the system, create one local user (called bob).
Don't forget his home.

Report: Boot from the hard drive.
Login with your csv476xx account, run {\ltt{}df}, 
report the amount disk free on your local drive.
This report (in addition to the one line df) should contain your machine name.
(Note: for the final, you really want to know the steps of the install;
for the report, all I want is to verify the install worked.
Save your notes about the install!)

Demonstration:
When your written report is ready,
tell the instructor the system is up,
he will ask you to demo by first logining as {\ltt{}bob}, and second as
you (csv476xx) and do a couple {\ltt{}ls} commands.
If the logins and the {\ltt{}ls} commands work he will accept your report.
\bye
