This project is about disk quotas.

On the machine you administer.

Set up user quotas (version 2) on your hard drive.
Specifically, set up {\it only} user quotas; do not set up group qoutas.

Give {\ltt{}bob} a quota of one megabyte (1024 blocks) of disk space.

Do not put any limit on his quota of inodes.

Testing: as {\ltt{}bob}, try to copy in {\ltt{}~djv/etherboot.img}.
(There is nothing special about this file, it's just a big file that
is also used for something else.)
You should get a "Disk quota exceeded message".

Report:

1) A summary of the steps you took to set up quotas.
That is, what commands did you issue and in what order.

2) The modified line from {\ltt{}fstab}.

3) The quota entry for {\ltt{}bob} as displayed by {\ltt{}edquota}.

4) The size of the {\ltt{}etherboot.img} file in {\ltt{}~djv} and
the size of the {\ltt{}etherboot.img} in {\ltt{}~bob}.

\bye
