This project is about configuring mail.

1) Send mail from your lab machine to your account on {\ltt{}cheetah}
using the verbose options ({\ltt{}-v}).
You will notice the conversation between the two machines.

2) On your lab machine send mail from your account to bob (on the
local machine) using the verbose option.

Examine the two outputs closely.

Report: what how do these two outputs differ?
(The difference is very small.)

For the remaining questions, examine the {\ltt{}sendmail.cf}
file on {\ltt{}panther}.

3) sendmail is set to forward to a smart host.
Report: the line in the {\ltt{}cf} that does this.

4) mail for {\ltt{}bob} and {\ltt{}root} is to be delivered locally and
not to the smart host.
Report: the line in the {\ltt{}cf} that does this.

5) The masquerade macro ({\ltt{}M}) is used in what ruleset?
Report the name of the ruleset and give one of the lines
in which the macro is used with the macro circled (or
somehow highlighted).
(That is, indicate where in the line the macro is being used.)
