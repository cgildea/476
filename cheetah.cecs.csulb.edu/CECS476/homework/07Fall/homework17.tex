Suddenly, the machine which you are assigned to administer,
contains an empty hard drive.
(When your are ready to do this project,
let me know so I can clean your machine's hard drive.)

Configure the machine according to the attached page (carefully).
If you don't include the correct software, later projects won't work..
If you botch the network configuration, your home directories won't
be available.

The root password should be set to the same word as before.

Once you have configured the system, create one local user (called bob).
Don't forget his home.

Report: Boot from the hard drive.
Login with your csa476xx account, 
run {\ltt{}ls} to make sure your home directory is there.
Then run {\ltt{}df}, and report the amount disk free on 
on all of your mounts.
This report (in addition to the one line df) should contain your machine name.
(Note: for the final, you really want to know the steps of the install;
for the report, all I want is to verify the install worked.
Save your notes about the install!)
