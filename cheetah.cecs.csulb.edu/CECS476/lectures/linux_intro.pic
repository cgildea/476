Linux: A version of Unix.

1) Copyrighted. The authors own it. 

2) Gnu Public License. 
\break
Full source is supplied.
\break
New source is publicly posted on the internet.
\break
You can use it, change it, sell it, copy it, give it away,
\break
--but, you must supply source to your changes.
\break
You may build and sell proprietary software that runs on it.

3) Multi-platform support.
\break
x86, AMD64, MIPS, Alpha, Power PC, SPARC, Itanium, ARM

4) Virtual memory.
\break
Swap space (disk) acts as slow RAM.
\break
Each process runs in its own virtual address space,
\break
Linux maps virtual to physical memory, physically
the process could be running in any part of RAM (or disk).

5) Network support. (TCP/IP, NIS, NFS)

6) Multi-process support.
\newslide
7) Documentation.
\break
Unix manual entries,
\break
How-To files (CDROM),
\break
FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions),
\break
Linux Documentation project
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/linux.html).

8) Usenet support.
(comp.os.linux.*)

9) X Window System support. XOrg.

\centerline{\bbf Linux/Unix Operating System Organization}

{\bbf Kernel:} Central utilities of the operating system.

Size and content varies.

Implements Virtual memory (memory management) and

process control (loads and runs programs).

Multi-process support (context switching, prioritization).

Supports concept of multiple users, groups of users, privilege.

Device drivers and low-level perpherial I/O

File systems 

Networking support

Pentium/Core: the kernel runs in protected mode.

MACH (micro) kernels (not Linux): 
\break
device drivers, networking software, are privileged ``user" programs
\newslide
\centerline{\bbf Linux Components}

Many programs run priviledged processes in user mode:

System programs:
\break
nfsd:  network file system server
\break
lpd: line printer controller
\break
inetd: network controller

Applications (priviledged):
\break
X11R6: window system.

Most user programs run with standard priviledges: 
\break
xfileman: file system manager.

\centerline{\bbf Services}

System services provide alot of system functionality

{\ltt{}init}--
\break
Controls start up and shutdown.
\break
Controlled by configuration files in {\ltt{}/etc/rc.d} directory
\break
Starts and terminates user programs

{\ltt{}agetty}--controls start of the login process

{\ltt{}inetd}--controls the starting of network utilities

{\ltt{}klogd, syslogd}--controls the log files

{\ltt{}nfsd, mountd}--controls the network file system
Your home directory is there, if the sysadmin did the setup right.

{\ltt{}ypbind}--controls network databases, including the
login/password database.

{\ltt{}kswapd}--controls virtual memory (paging)

{\ltt{}kflushd}--controls file buffering 


{\ltt{}portmap}--necessary for any rpc service
