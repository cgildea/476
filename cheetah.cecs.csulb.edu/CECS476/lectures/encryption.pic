\centerline{\bbf Encryption}

Several means of encryption are available.

{\ltt{}gpg}: Gnu Privacy Guard.
Will encrypt or decrypt a file.
Output the result to {\ltt{}stdout}

Basic options:
\break
{\ltt{}e}: encrypt
\break
{\ltt{}d}: decrypt
\break
{\ltt{}s}: sign a document

You can specify which encryption algorithm to use,
or use the defaults.

You can use large keys and keep them on/in an encrypted
key-ring protected by a passphrase.

You can crypt simply using a pass phrase.

\newslide

{\ltt{}cryptdir}, {\ltt{}decryptdir}:

Encrypt or decrypt the files in a directory.

You specify a pass phrase
\break
(twice to make sure you don't goof).

Each encrypted file has a {\ltt{}.crypt} on the end.

Files ending in {\ltt{}.crypt} are not encrypted.

The directory structure is not modified.

Side effect: you can add a file to a directory and {\ltt{}cryptdir} will
encrypt only that file.

This program has no options.
