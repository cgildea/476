\centerline{\bbf Warnings}

You will be given system administrator privileges on a machine,
this makes it very easy to destroy the disk, hence the capability
of the machine to run.
\break
It will be possible that you can destroy other user's accounts.

Rules:
\break
1) Read the instructions.
\break
2) Administer only the machine assigned to you.
\break
3) Assignments may involve lynx, cougar, jaguar, panther.
These are shared with other courses.
You may install software in your home directory that runs on these (please ask).
Do not attempt to administer these machines.
\break
4) Use your administrator (root)  privileges
{\bit only} to complete the assignments.
\break
5) Maintain a log of what you do as the system administrator .
(You will be able to repeat it if it worked. 
It will be easier to correct it if it broke something.
You will find it helpful in the exams.)
\break
7) Do not change passwords unless instructed to do so.
\break
Before some administrative assignments, 
I will access your machine to disable or remove something which you 
will have to fix or install.
