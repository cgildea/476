\centerline{A Brief Look}

Same capabilities as INN.
\break
Similar configuration issures.
\break
Slightly different files and file contents.
\break
Non-integerated approach.

{\ltt{}rnews}: accepts incoming news and stores it in the incoming spool

{\ltt{}newsrun}: processes incoming spool into news directory heirarchy

{\ltt{}inews}: accepts postings and stores them in the outgoing spool

{\ltt{}relaynews}: screens out inactive groups, duplicate and stale articles

{\ltt{}uucp, nntpd}: transfer news to another machine.

Configuration files:

{\ltt{}active}:
\break
List of news feeds, includes self.
\break
List of active news groups
\break
must include {\ltt{}junk} and {\ltt{}control} groups

\newslide
{\ltt{}newsgroup}: Has the high, low (article numbers) and
permission (post, moderated, feed through).

{\ltt{}sys}: controls what goes to and comes from newsfeeds.
Format similar to innd newsfeeds
\break
Includes transfer control flags:
\break
ihave/sendme: slow connections
\break
batching control (compress and send)

for batching also set up {\ltt{}batchparams} to specify batch sizes
and compression method (one line per newsfeed site)

{\ltt{}explist}: how long you hold the articles (by news group)

{\ltt{}mailname}: Return address (in header)
\break
{\ltt{}organization}: for that line in the header

Usually you use utilities like {\ltt{}addgroup} instead of editing files.
