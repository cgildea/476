\centerline{\bbf WAIS}
\centerline{Wide Area Information Service}

A method of searching for information on the Internet.

Principles of operation:
\break
1) You index the information available at your site
\break
2) You register your index as part of WAIS
\break
3) Others now contact your server to search your index

For speed: the index of information available at your site is
stored in index files (databases).
\break
Your server uses those files to answer search queries

Usually you index your ftp archive.

If you are registered, the registrar server will include your
server in net-wide queries.
\newslide
WAIS components:

{\ltt{}waisindex}: Builds the index files.
\break
Argument: name of the directories and files to be included in the index.
\break
Other options: 
\break
--name of the index file
\break
---creates xx.doc, xx.dct, xx.fn, ...
\break
--recurse directory option
\break
--index line within files or one reference per file.
\break
--give a file with words not to be indexed
\break
--indicate type of files to index (text, gif, html)

Example:
\break
{\ltt{}waisindex -d foo /usr/man/man1/*}
\break
Indexes contents of all files in {\ltt{}/usr/man/man1}
\break
creates: foo.doc, foo.dct, foo.fn

{\ltt{}waisindex -export -register}: Registers our server with
the Wide Area Information Service.
\break
Arguments: the names of our index files
\break
Others now we have a server running.

\vfill
Homework notes: we will {\bit not} export/register
\break
Use default index names (omit {\ltt{}-d} option)

\newslide
{\ltt{}waisserver}: the query server
\break
Port 210
\break
--answers search queries
\break
--may be run from inetd.
\break
Options to override port, specify the name of the index files...

{\ltt{}waissearch}: the query client.
\break
Specify the words to look up.
\break
Should specify the server to contact.

Examples:

{\ltt{}waisserver -d foo}
\break
Run the wais server, offer up the foo database

{\ltt{}waissearch -h 134.139.45.6 -d foo  HELP}
\break
Contact the server on jaguar, ask it for all references
to the word HELP in the foo database.

Homework note: the (default) most used database name is {\ltt{}INFO}

\newslide
\centerline{\bbf Gopher}

A method of searching and retrieving information for on the Internet.

Gopher client connects to a Gopher server to retrieve information.

Client: menu driven interface.
\break
select an item, it takes you to another menu
\break
some selections retrieve files.

Menu item:
\break
Type (text, directory, binary, gif)
\break
Description (for the menu display)
\break
Name of file (or directory)
\break
Host name (where to get file or directory)
\break
port
Port host expects you to use for gopher (70)

Gopher menu entry:

{\program
Name=Other Information
Type=0
Port=70
Path=/usr/sam/gopher_info
Host=lab17.net.cecs.csulb.edu
\endprogram}

\newslide
{\bbf Gopher Client}

1) Telnet to a system that provices a public gopher client
\break
(login gopher, the login program is the gopher client)

2) Run a gopher client locally.

Client must be told the initial server.

Gopher clients can request searches and index searches

A menu selection can be a telnet session.
\newslide
{\bbf Gopher Server}

{\ltt{}gopherd.conf}

Decoders: compression can be used (zcat, gzcat)
\break
You must tell gopher where to find these programs.

ignore: directory name/file name
\break
gopher clients are not allowed to look at these

{\ltt{}gopherdlocal.conf}

Information about your local site,
\break
name, administator, time zone, language.

access: list of hosts and users
\break
Access is restricted, 
\break
capabilities can be restricted by site
