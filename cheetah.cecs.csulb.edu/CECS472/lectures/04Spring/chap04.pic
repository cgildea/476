Problem: How to talk to TCP/IP

Sockets provide an interface to the network facilities

Other interfaces to TCP/IP include TLI (Transport Layer Interface)

Design decision: the nature of the interface
\newslide
\centerline{\bbf Operating System Interfaces}

Some way of accessing system capabilities is needed.

Including: 
file access,
terminal access,
protection (passwd, access permissions), 
interprocess communications,
synchronization capabilities, 
and network communications.

Methodology: System calls
\break
What calls are/should be provided?

Berkeley Unix design decision: files.
\break
Interprocess communication = pipes = file like
\break
disks and terminals = special files
\break
Network communication = sockets = file like

\centerline{\bbf File Operations in Unix}

{\bbf open}: get I/O access to a file

{\bbf close}: end access to a file

{\bbf read}: get information from a file

{\bbf write}: send information to a file

{\bbf lseek}: shift position in a file

{\bbf ioctl}: I/O control, do something with a file
\vt
Socket Operations:

Will follow file operations as closely as pratical

{\bit Overview:}

TCP/IP: Specifies how two machines communicate. 
It specifies the network facilities provided.

Sockets: Specifies how to talk to the TCP/IP network facilities.
Other methods of talking to the network facilities are allowed.

For machines to communicate both must use TCP/IP.
They {\bit do not} both have to use sockets.
