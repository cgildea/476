\centerline{Use of the Unix System on a Network}

{\ltt{}man} -- read a manual entry
\break
{\ltt{}man ls} -- gives you the entry for {\ltt{}ls}
\break
{\ltt{}man 5 hosts.equiv} -- section 5 entry for {\ltt{}hosts.equiv}
\break
{\ltt{}man -k disk} -- lists all manual entries whose summaries include
the work {\bit disk}

Warning: machines differ
\break
Read the manual for the correct machine

Linux pseudo terminals: 
\break
you have 6 terminals, alt-F1 .. alt-F6
\break
you can have up to 6 logins from one keyboard
\break
don't forget to logout on all terminals you were using
\newslide
\centerline{\bbf Compilers}

{\ltt{}gcc} -- the standard c compiler

Warning: what you compile on one machine will not run on another.

{\ltt{}.o} files created by one compiler cannot be used by another.

Technique: fully recompile, leave no {\ltt{}.o} files.

\vt
Example:

{\ltt{}gcc x.c y.c z.c -o prog.out}

Compiles 3 files, calls the executable {\ltt{}prog.out}
\vt
Note: sometimes the compiler is called {\ltt{}gcc}
\break
One file must contain a function called {\ltt{}main}

\newslide
\centerline{\bbf Network Designations}

Machines have first (middle) and last names:

{\ltt{}cheetah.cecs.csulb.edu}
\break
{\ltt{}prep.ai.mit.edu}

Sometimes shorthand can be used ({\ltt{}cheetah})
\break
if set up by the network coordinator.

Users can be refered to on remote machines.

{\ltt{}hostmaster@nic.ddn.mil}
\break
{\ltt{}pres@whitehouse.gov}
\break
{\ltt{}mahoney@astro.engr.csulb.edu}

Format:

user name \quad {\ltt{}@} \quad machine

\newslide
\centerline{\bbf Applications you should know/learn}

{\ltt{}telnet} -- connect to a machine on the network

{\ltt{}telnet cheetah.cecs.csulb.edu}
\break
By default connects to the telnet server
\break
You will be asked for an account name and a password
\vt
{\ltt{}rlogin} -- log into another Unix machine on the network

By default it uses the same account name on the machine you are trying to
reach.
\break
An option allows you to access say which account you wish to access on
the destination machine.
\break
A password or appropriate authorization is required.
\vt
{\ltt{}ftp} -- copy a files from/to another machine on a network

{\ltt{}ftp cheetah.cecs.csulb.edu}
\break
you must login to the other machine
\break
{\ltt{}anonymous} login is sometimes allowed
\break
--i.e., you don't need an account or password
\newslide
{\ltt{}rcp} -- copy a file from/to another Unix machine on a network.

{\ltt{}rcp  spy@cia.org:map.ps spymap.ps}
\break
Authorization is required.
Either the source, the destination or both may be on other machines.
\break
(Example is from a remote machine to a local file)
\vt
\centerline{\bbf Network Information}

There are several network databases that may be accessed.

{\ltt{}nslookup}: (Domain name service): access data about
machines on the network.

{\ltt{}finger}: access login information about a (remote or local) user.
The argument can be the users mail address.


{\ltt{}whois}: access the internet user name directory service

\vskip 0pt plus1filll
The above are representative. 
Other more elegant programs exist, but these require minimum resources.
