\centerline{Application Gateways}

Concept: Make available internet capabilities on a non-internet machine.

General concept: Make capabilities on one network available on a different
network.

Application Gateway: runs on a machine ``attached" to both networks.
\break
Transfers client requests from one network to a server on another 
network.

Gateway software: 
\break
must handle protocols on two networks
\break
must recognize which requests need to be gateway'd
\break
If the application requires security (private data base),
it should worry about security

Mail sent from Dial-up net machines can be sent to internet machines by 
addressing them to the gateway.

From {\ltt{}minty}: {\ltt{}gateway!joe@cheetah}
\break
Minty sends this mail to gateway.
\break
Gateway gets this mail from the dial-up net
\break
Gateway knows from the {\ltt{}@} this is internet mail,
\break
so it converts it to internet mail and
\break
sends it to joe at cheetah.

From {\ltt{}cheetah}: {\ltt{}minty!george@gateway}
\break
Cheetah sends this mail to gateway.
\break
Gateway gets this mail from the internet.
\break
Gateway knows ({\ltt{}minty!}) this is to the dial-up net
\break
so it converts it to dial-up net mail and
\break
sends it minty.

\centerline{\bbf The Mail Gateway}
\centerline{(Details)}

May need to reformat mail messages
\break
May modify reply field so that correct reply address can be constructed

Usually two processes:

Process 1: Handles incoming mail messages,
\break
Computes reply address,
\break
routes mail to destination,
\break
deposits in incoming message queue.

Process 2: Handles outgoing mail messages
\break
Scans outgoing message queue,
\break
makes connection to destination for a message ,
\break
sends the message.
\break
If it cannot send, it returns message to queue and
\break
retries for a fixed amount of time (e.g., three days),
\break
after which it delivers an error message (unable to send) to sender.

\centerline{\bbf Gateways versus Tunneling}
\vt
Tunneling: 

Uses a foriegn network to connect two similar networks.

The information passes through the foriegn network.

Foriegn network doesn't need to understand the data
\vt
Application Gateways:
you interact with a client/server on the foriegn network.

Gateway needs to understand both data formats.

Must be able to translate requests and replies between two formats.

The application sends from minty to the application gateway.

The application gateway converts format and sends to the router

The request/data has made two trips (hops) down the cable.
\newslide
\centerline{\bbf Application Gateways}

One application can use another.

Example: file transfer can be accomplished using mail.

Reason: more places have mail than have ftp.

Example:
The client needs to get some request for comments (RFC) documents.

Book solution: Connect the FTP and electronic mail services 
while controlling access and ensuring authorization

Real solution: transfer files using the mail application.

1) Client mails request for file 
\break
2) Server mails back the file
\vt
Example: Internet browsers: allow the user to traverse the internet
selecting the data they want to retrieve.

Implementation: use ftp, archie, and other applications.
\break
The user doesn't need to know how the retrieval is done.
