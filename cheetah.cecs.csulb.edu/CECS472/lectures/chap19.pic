\centerline{Application Gateways}

Concept: Make available internet capabilities on a non-internet machine.

General concept: Make capabilities on one network available on a different
network.

Application Gateway: runs on a machine ``attached" to both networks.
\break
Transfers client requests from one network to a server on another 
network.

Gateway software: 
\break
must handle protocols on two networks
\break
must recognize which requests need to be gateway'd
\break
If the application requires security (private data base),
it should worry about security

File requests from {\ltt{}win302} can be served using files on {\ltt{}d1}.

From {\ltt{}win302}: Windows format for a file request
\break
{\ltt{}win302} sends this request to {\ltt{}psvr404}.
\break
{\ltt{}psvr404} gets this request
\break
it knows this request is for a file from the Unix server
\break
so it converts it to Network File System request
\break
sends it to {\ltt{}d1}.

{\ltt{}d1}: gets an NFS request
\break
{\ltt{}d1} sends the data to {\ltt{}psvr404}.
\break
{\ltt{}psvr404} gets this data.
\break
{\ltt{}psvr404} knows the data is for a Windows machine
\break
so it converts the data into Windows format and
\break
sends it {\ltt{}win302}.

Result: your Unix home directory appears as the {\ltt{}Z:} drive.

\centerline{\bbf Application Gateways versus Tunneling}
\vt
Tunneling: 

Uses a foreign network to connect two similar networks.

The information passes through the foriegn network.

Foriegn network doesn't need to understand the data
\vt
Application Gateways:

you interact with a client/server that uses foreign protocol.

Gateway needs to understand both protocols.

Must be able to translate requests and replies between two protocols

The application sends from minty to the application gateway.

The application gateway converts format and sends to the router

The request/data has made two trips (hops) down the cable.
\newslide
\centerline{\bbf Application Gateways}

One application can use another.

Example: database access can be accomplished using http.

Example:
The client needs to get some student data.

1) The client makes an http request.
\break
2) The http server converts the request into a database request
and sends it to the database server.
\break
3) The http server formats the database server's response
into html and sends it back to the client.

Note:
\break
The client/user doesn't need to know how the retrieval is done.
