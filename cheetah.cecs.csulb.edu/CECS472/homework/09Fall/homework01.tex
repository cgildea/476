Purpose: This assignment forces you to refresh your skills with the Unix
systems.
It also serves as a review of file operations.

Get a copy of the file {\ltt{}~volper/classes/472/shells/copy.c}.
You will need to be on {\ltt{}cheetah} access this file.

This program in this file takes one argument. 
That arguement should be the name of a (text) file.
The program copies that file to the screen.

Modify the program so it takes two arguements.
The first will be the name of the source file, the second
will be the name of the destination file.
Further modify the program so it opens (creates) the destination
file and copies the source file into it.
Don't forget to close the destination.

Call your finished program {\ltt{}copy.c}.

Hint: if you've done any recent Unix programming, this assignment
should only take you a few minutes.
The intent is to help bring those haven't done recent Unix programming
back up to speed.

Additional task: When you are on {\ltt{}cheetah} run the {\ltt{}register}
program. This will associate you grade with your account so
I can get you onto my grade sheet.  This action is logged so
no submission is necessary.
