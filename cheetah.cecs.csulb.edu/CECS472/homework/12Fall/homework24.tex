Purpose: To use the secure socket layer.

You will build an upgraded TCP time client/server pair
from your homework.
You will call your client {\ltt{}STtimec.c}.
You will call your server {\ltt{}STtimed.c}.
They will be upgrades of your {\ltt{}Ttimec.c} and {\ltt{}Ttimed.c}
respectively.

Upgrade:

Your client and server should talk to each other using a secure
socket (ssl).
This means that they both must use SSL.

As observed in lecture, an established TCP connection can be
converted to use SSL. You will need to add the code necessary to do this.

{\ltt{}~volper/classes/472/programs/ssl} contains copies
of the primitive secure client and secure server from lecture.
These are called {\ltt{}ssl_client.c} and {\ltt{}ssl_server.c}.
You should probably get a copy of the contents of this directory
and make sure that you can get the client and server to communicate.

Submit: a printout of your {\ltt{}STtimec.c} and {\ltt{}STtimed.c} files.

Copies of these files must be located in your class home directory;
and have the name above.

Compiling: You will need to tell the compiler to link in the ssl library.
To do this add a ``{\ltt{}-lssl}" after the list of files to compile.
