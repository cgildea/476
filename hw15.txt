This project is about ftp.
1) On you local machine, check your ftpusers and proftpd.conf files to make sure that both network
(NIS/yp) accounts and anonymous ftp are allowed.

/etc/ftpusers contains users that cannot ftp. Remove ftp from list to allow anonymous ftp.

2) Log into jaguar. Ftp to your local machine. Use the username anonymous. Get the dummy test file. (If
you don't have a dummy test file under ~ftp, make one up.)
Report: The ftp command used, and what it says when you login.

From Jaguar:
ftp lab68
anonymous
(enter) for password
get test.txt

csa476u1@jaguar:~$ ftp lab68
Connected to lab68.net.cecs.csulb.edu.
220 ProFTPD 1.3.3e Server (ProFTPD Default Installation) [134.139.248.68]
Name (lab68:csa476u1): anonymous
331 Anonymous login ok, send your complete email address as your password
Password:
230 Anonymous access granted, restrictions apply
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.

ftp> get test.txt
local: test.txt remote: test.txt
200 PORT command successful
550 test.txt: No such file or directory

3) Modify the anonymous account so it will put up a greeting message when at the start of an anonmyous
ftp.
Test: go back to jaguar, ftp to anonymous on your machine and make sure you see the message.
Report: what changes did you make (give file names too).

As root@lab68:
echo "Welcome anonymous user" >> ~ftp/welcome.msg

From Jaguar:

4) Go back to jaguar. Ftp to your local machine. Use the username bob. Get the demo file. (If you didn't
remember to make a demo file when you created bob, login as bob and create a text file called demo.)
Report: The commands used.

csa476u1@jaguar:~$ ftp lab68
Connected to lab68.net.cecs.csulb.edu.
220 ProFTPD 1.3.3e Server (ProFTPD Default Installation) [134.139.248.68]
Name (lab68:csa476u1): bob
331 Password required for bob
Password:
230 User bob logged in
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> get demo
local: demo remote: demo
200 PORT command successful
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for demo (26 bytes)
226 Transfer complete
26 bytes received in 0.0572 secs (0.44 Kbytes/sec)

5) Change the settings on ftp so that bob may not use ftp. All other ftp capabilities should still be allowed.
Note: several other users are usually not allowed to use ftp, including root, uucp news; do not change
these permissions.
Test: make sure that bob cannot use ftp into your machine and your account can.
Report: Exactly what change you made and to what file/directory you made that change.

In /etc/ftpusers:
#ftp
root
uucp
news
bob

6) Dynamically and statically loaded libraries. Compare the clogitA and clogitB commands found in
~djv. Examine the size of the two commands and use ldd to look at the dynamically loaded libraries.
Report: the difference between the two commands (sizes and dynamic libraries).

root@lab68:/net/cheetah/u3/volper# ldd clogitA
	linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff27dff000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb22cb6d000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb22cf29000)
root@lab68:/net/cheetah/u3/volper# ldd clogitB
	not a dynamic executable

root@lab68:/net/cheetah/u3/volper# ls -alh | grep clogit
-rw-r--r--  1 djv  faculty  695 Jan 23  2008 clogit.c
-rwxr-xr-x  1 djv  faculty 9.0K Mar 14  2013 clogitA*
-rwxr-xr-x  1 djv  faculty 848K Mar 14  2013 clogitB*

clogitA is a dynamic library and clogitB is a static library and much larger than clogitA
