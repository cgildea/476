This assignment covers the boot/root disks, and what is on the release DVD.
1) fdisk: For the disk you administer describe the partitions that are on the disk? For each partition
report, where it starts, where it ends, and what kind of a partition it is (Linux, DOS, swap). Be very
careful with this one, you have to be root to run fdisk, DO NOT MODIFY or WRITE anything with fdisk;
you can easily erase the disk. Record the information very carefully, you have to use this information to
rebuild after your disk crash.

2) pkgtool: What packages are installed on the machine you administer. Report just the first 6. Don't
bother to record the others, you will be told what to install in the instructions for the install project.

pkgtool
hit R to view installed packages, just dont remove any!

Consolekit, M2Crypto, PyQt, QScintilla, a2p2, aaa_base

3) etherboot: Examine the installation DVD image on jaguar (slack13.37. What is an etherboot?
Hint 1: it's a PXE installer. Hint 2: see the README.

Allows botting from a single floppy disk.

This is simple enough it can be summed up in point form:

 - Ensure your DHCP, TFTP, & NFS servers are up & running.
 - Boot the client from the Etherboot floppy.
 - Select an appropriate driver from which to boot. If you're unsure
   which to choose, try several at random until one works.
 - Once you see the "Welcome to Slackware" banner, you will be running
   the installer itself. Carry on with a normal NFS install.



4) dhcp/tftp: Examine the dhcpd.conf jaguar. What is the name of the file that will be download using
tftp to start the boot sequence on your machine? What is the host entry for your machine?

In /etc/dhcpd.conf
filename "/tftpboot/pxelinux.0";

  host lab68 {
    #hardware ethernet 00:11:11:92:09:db ;
    hardware ethernet 00:22:4d:4c:79:03 ;
    fixed-address 134.139.248.68 ;
  }

5) The installation DVD is available using "boot from network". Boot the installation DVD from the
network. (I want to make sure you can do this before we erase your harddrive.)
Report the number of entries you found in /bin. (This answer doesn't have any importance, it's just to
make sure that you've been able to do the boot.)

195 entries in /bin/
