Examine the password and group files on cheetah and answer the following questions:
For the old instructor’s account (volper) answer the following questions:
1) What is the UID (user) number?

100

2) What is the GID (group) number?
id -g volper
30

3) What is the home directory?
 echo ~volper
/net/aardvark/u1/volper

4) What is the login shell?
 
/bin/csh

5) What is the name of the base group the instructor belongs to? 
faculty:x:30:

6) The user djv belongs to three additional groups, what are the names of this group? 
id -G djv
30 10 12 100

7) What are the group numbers for the groups named guest, cecsu and cecsg?

guest:x:60:
cecsu:x:71:
cecsg:x:72:

Examine the shadow file on the lab66 machine (Should be world readable, if not, inform the instructor)
and answer the following questions:
8) List the local accounts that have (encrypted) passwords. Hint: there are a very small number of such
accounts. 
root:$1$BB2sRjzi$Ik9DrbLXMknCgOtwXKFBE/:16457:0:::::

9) When (approximately) was the password on the root account changed? Give me a month and year. This
will be approximate, that is, it may be off by a couple days.
Hint, use bc to help compute the year it was changed (assume 365.25 days per year), and roughly estimate
the month (assume 30 days per month).

January, 2015

10) There is an alternate command available to show this on your machine (but not all Unix systems).
Give this command.

chage -l root

11) Explain why marking the shadow file world readable is a poor decision.

It is possible that the encryption strategy used to encrypt the password could be cracked in the future like MD5 was and give an unauthorized user access to encrypted passwords.

Examine your .cshrc and answer the following questions:
12) How many aliases are setup?

vim ~/.cshrc
3
alias lf ls -aCF
alias l ls -al
alias term 'set noglob ; eval `tset -rsQ \!*` ; set glob'

13) How many directories in your path?

echo $PATH
/net/cheetah/u3/c/csa476/u1/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/bin:/bin:/etc:/usr/etc:/usr/cecs/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/local/bin:.
12

Modify your .cshrc. Remember, the .cshrc file is only read when you login. I recommend you modify in
one window and use a second window to login and test your changes (that way you won’t lock yourself out.
Be sure to verify that your changes work.
14) Add an alias have p be a shorthand for ps aux. Give the command to do this.

alias p 'ps aux'

15) Add the directory ~djv to the end of your path. After you have done this, from your home directory,
you should be able to run the hello program (which prints Hello). This program exists only in the ~djv
directory.

Inserted ~djv into the path in ~/.cshrc, logged out and back in and typed hello and got Hello as a response.
