Purpose: This assignment is to familiarize you with setting up users and logins.
System Admin: When you submit assignment 2, you should ask for (and get) a system administrator
(root) account. If you didn’t you will need to do so when you start this assignment.
Submission: You will submit hw03.txt with “˜grader/submit 03”. Put you name, account and machine on
your document. The document will contain the exact version of each command you did. If you did an edit,
tell me exactly what change you made to the file. You will leave the user login setup on your computer.
On the lab machine, you are assigned to administer set up the following two accounts. Do not use a script,
do all the steps individually, by hand.
Account 1:
Name bob
Password: access31
UID: 13101
Default group: cecsu
Home directory: /home/bob
Account 2:
Name sue
Password: access32
UID: 13102
Default group: cecsg
Home directory: /home/sue
For both accounts:
Shell: /bin/csh
Home directory contents, 3 files: .cshrc, .login and demo.
The .cshrc and .login files should be identical to those in the home directory of the djv account. You
should create the demo file using an editor and it should contain one line of text saying, “Hi there, welcome
to CECS”. (Note, this last file has no particular purpose other than to make sure you know how to set up
permissions and ownership correctly.)
The protection of the home directories should be 755. The file ownership and group access of all files and
directories should be correctly set. Because these groups come in over the network, you will need to look at
the group file on cheetah for the group numbers. Do not modify your local group file.
Note: If you did not do so in Assignment 2, you will need to look at the group file on cheetah to find out
the approriate group numbers for these accounts.
Testing:
When the instructor grades your homework the following tests will be performed on your assignment:
Login as your new user. Run pwd to make sure the home directory is where it is supposed to be. Run ls
-al to make sure the files are there, that they have the correct user and group and that your user doesn’t
own files outside the user’s home directory
