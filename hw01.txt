Purpose: To familiarize you with the systems you will be using.
Submission: You will submit a document (text file) called hw01.txt via the command “˜grader/submit
01”. As a reminder, this document and all submissions in this course will have a header containing the
following information:
Your name, your login name, and the name of the machine on which you did the assignment (see label on
the front, or use hostname command).
All the questions will also serve to drill you on the organization of the Linux file system. The first three
questions are also a drill on using the online manual.
How many users are listed in the password file of the server cheetah? (Fortunately there is one user per
line.) Hint: use man -k to find a command that prints the number of lines in a file.
1) Report: the number of entries in the password file and the command you used to find out.

	"man -k number of lines"
	"nl /etc/passwd"
     1	root:x:0:0::/root:/bin/bash
     2	bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/bin/false
     3	daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/bin/false
     4	adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/log:/bin/false
     5	lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/bin/false
     6	sync:x:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync
     7	shutdown:x:6:0:shutdown:/sbin:/sbin/shutdown
     8	halt:x:7:0:halt:/sbin:/sbin/halt
     9	mail:x:8:12:mail:/:/bin/false

File system organization:
Examine: the configuration file that controls the inetd system service on your Linux system.
2) Report: What is the exact name of this file, in what directory did you find this file, and what commands
did you use to do this.

locate inetd
ls -l /etc/inetd.conf 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4588 Aug 15  2011 /etc/inetd.conf

Locate: the program that will tell the disk space usage on your Linux system.
3) Report: What is the name of that program, in what directory (where) is the program found and what
commands did you use to do this.

lab68> man -k disk space usage
lab68> which df
/usr/bin/df
lab68> df
Filesystem         1K-blocks     Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/root           69231284  3863636  61850868   6% /
tmpfs                1001832        0   1001832   0% /dev/shm
134.139.248.17:/u3 480720640  9027840 447273728   2% /net/cheetah/u3
134.139.248.17:/u4 480720640 55233024 401068288  13% /net/cheetah/u4

The next 5 questions are designed to make you use various commands with specific options. The answers
themselves are of minor interest, the drill here is on use of various Unix commands. These commands will
be frequently used by you in later assignments.
Report the answer to each of the following questions and the commands you used to find that answer.
4) Your /etc/X11 directory should contain templates for the configuration file for the X window system,
what are the names of these files/this file? (Hint: the file names start with xorg.)

lab68> cd /etc/X11
lab68> ls xorg*
xorg.conf-vesa

xorg.conf.d:

5) In the /usr/lib64 directory, there are several entries that support the Xfontcache (the library name
includes those letters). What are the full names of those entries? (Hint, use ls with wild cards).

lab68> cd /usr/lib64
lab68> ls *Xfontcache*
libXfontcache.la*  libXfontcache.so@  libXfontcache.so.1@  libXfontcache.so.1.0.0*

6) Examine the /proc file system. What is the cpu MHz of your machine. Hint: this is information about
the cpu and can be obtained using the cat command on the correct pseudo-file.

lab68> grep cpuinfo *
...
lab68> grep MHz cpuinfo 
cpu MHz		: 2992.195
cpu MHz		: 2992.195

Examine the log files on the serverjaguar (Hint: You will need to ssh or telnet to jaguar):
7) Give the names of the last 3 log files that have changed and the dates at which they changed.

jaguar> cd /var/log/
jaguar> ls -ltr
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    37627344 Jan 22 18:21 syslog
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     4751001 Jan 22 18:21 messages
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     5926724 Jan 22 18:21 lastlog

8) Give the last 3 lines found in the messages log file.

less +G /var/log/messages
