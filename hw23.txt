This project is about rdist.
You will use rdist to install a file from panther to the machine you administer.
1) On the machine you administer, if you didn't include rdist in your reload, mount the cd from panther
and install the rdist capabilities.

2) Create a file called junk in your home directory (~css476x4). Put some ASCII message in this file like
"Hello". This is the file to be distributed from panther to your machine.

csa476u1@panther:~$ touch junk (hehe)

3) Set up an rdist command file that does the following:

A) copies the file onto your machine as /tmp/junk

B) changes the mode on that file to be 755

In distfile:
junk -> bob@lab68.net.cecs.csulb.edu
install /tmp/junk ;
special "chmod 755 /tmp/junk" ;

4) Set the machine you administer so that the bob account on that machine (or whatever account you
created) will accept rdist from your class account on panther.

in .rhosts:
panther.net.cecs.csulb.edu csa476u1

5) login to panther (using your class account). Run the rdist command.
Check on the machine you administer to make sure the junk file appeared and has the right mod.
Submit: what exactly did you do at step (4), a copy of your rdist command file and the exact form of the
rdist command you used.

csa476u1@panther:~$ rdist -f distfile
