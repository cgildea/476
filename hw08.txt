Build and boot with a new installation of the kernel.
A copy of the configuration file used for your standard kernel is found in /boot/config. Use this file only
to copy it to /usr/src/linux/ as .config, do not modify it.
I recommend you compile and install to make sure it works. (I.e., skip the “eliminate” part of step A for
now and compile and install a ”stock” kernel to make sure you know the procedure). This kernel should be
almost the same size as the stock kernel and should work exactly like the stock kernel
A) Configure the kernel.
Desirable: Eliminate any unnecessary drivers and/or components so that your kernel is as small as
possible. Minimal: Eliminate at least one unnecessary kernel component so your kernel is smaller than the
stock kernel (hint, your system does not have firewire ports).

Your machine has: an IDE hard drive, a SATA Hard drive, a PCI bus, a PS/2 mouse and an Intel
PRO/1000 on board network adapter.

cp /boot/config /usr/src/linux/.config

make config

make menuconfig

make dep


If you get into trouble in step B, copy it in as .config and start again.
B) Build a new kernel (bzImage).

Make the kernel image:

make bzImage -

1) Report: the date stamp on the bzImage file.
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 5866464 Feb 23 14:23 bzImage

C) Modify the lilo.conf file to have a second linux bootable configuration. Duplicate the 4 lines and two
comment lines (total of 7 lines), change the image to bzImage and the label to bz. Make sure the original
bootable configuration entry stays first so that it is the default

image = /boot/bzImage
  root = /dev/sda2
  label = bz
  read-only  # Partitions should be mounted read-only for checking
# Linux bootable partition config ends

D) Move the new kernel so that it is /boot/bzImage. (Do NOT under ANY circumstances remove or
replace vmlinuz)

mv bzImage /boot/

E) Run lilo, it should show two “Added” reports.

lilo
Warning: LBA32 addressing assumed
Added linux *
Added bz
One warning was issued.

F) Reboot, shift key down; select bz. Note: If shift key doesn’t work, uncomment “prompt” and “timeout
= 500” in lilo.conf and rerun lilo.

Make sure your kernel is working by, i) can bob login (and ls his home dir) ii) can your personal account
login (and ls your home dir).
2) Report: the contents of /proc/sys/kernel/version
Kernel Verson:
#2 SMP Mon Feb 23 14:23:12 PST 2015

3) Report: the size of you new kernel and the size of the stock kernel
New:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5.6M Feb 23 14:23 bzImage

Old:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5.6M Feb 23 14:23 vmlinux.bin*
