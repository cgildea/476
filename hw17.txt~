Suddenly, the machine which you are assigned to administer, contains an empty hard drive. (When your
are ready to do this project, let me know so I can “clean” your machine’s hard drive.)
Configure the machine according to the attached page (carefully). If you don’t include the correct software,
later projects won’t work.. If you botch the network configuration, your home directories won’t be available.
Do not configure the sdb drive, that will be done by students next semester.
The root password should be set to the same as before.
Once you have configured the system, create one local user (called bob). Don’t forget his home directory.
Report: Boot from the hard drive. Login with your csa476xx account, run ls to make sure your home
directory is there. Then run df, and report the amount disk free on on all of your mounts. This report (in
addition to the one line df) should contain your machine name. (Note: for the final, you really want to
know the steps of the install; for the report, all I want is to verify the install worked. Save your notes
about the install!)
