Syslogâ~
Set up your machine so that it logs all mail activity on your machine to a file called /var/log/mymaillog.
Note: this is a change in the name of the log file. Send mail from your machine and make sure the new log
file records this.
1) Report: the line you put into the syslog.conf that did this.

In /etc/syslog.conf:
# Mail related logs:
mail.*                                                  -/var/log/mymaillog

In /etc/rc.d/
./rc.syslog restart

Set up your machine so that it logs all mail activity on your machine to jaguar.net.cecs.csulb.edu.
(Please don't swamp jaguar by logging everything.)
Send mail from your machine and make sure the log records this works. Note: On jaguar, you will need to
examine the syslog.conf to see what file that jaguar puts this log information into. The name of the log
file on jaguar is slightly different from the name of the logfile I've asked you to use on your machine.
2) Report: the line you put into the syslog.conf that did this.
Clean up: Remove the jaguar entry from your syslog.conf.

In /etc/syslog.conf:
# Mail related logs:
mail.*                                                  @jaguar.net.cecs.csulb.edu

In /etc/rc.d/ 
./rc.syslog restart

Printers?~
Remove everything from your print spool (lprm). Use lpq to make sure it's empty.
Your machine uses the lpd print server. Add a line to your printcap so that your machine can print to the
printer on psvr. This printer attached to psvr.net.cecs.csulb.edu is as psvr and as lp. Make the
printer on psvr the default printer for the system (lp). Make sure you can print using the lpr command.

3) Report: the line that you added to the printcap. Do not submit the entire printcap.



4) Submission: This homework is to be a paper submission. Print it using the newly formed printcap to
psvr and submit to me.
