This project is about general networking. You will be asked about existing configurations. In general the
answers to the questions can be found on the machine for which you are an administrator. No root
priviledges should be necessary to answer any of the questions.
Questions about network drivers. (visit drivers/net in the kernel source code)
1) Support for several types of 3-Com (3cXXX) cards are available for the unix kernel, list 4 such cards.

cd /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/
ls 3c*
3c501.c 
3c503.c 
3c505.c 
3c507.c  

2) The etherworks 3 (ewrk3) driver supports what three cards?

grep card ewrk3.c

DE203
DE204
DE205

3) On a Parallel line cable running PLIP, what are pins 18,19 and 20?

grep -r 18 .

Pins 18, 19, and 20 appear to be extra grounds.


Questions about configuration of TCP/IP. (examine the front of your machine, also run the ifconfig and
netstat commands)
4) Use a command to find out the fully qualified hostname of your machine? What is the fully qualified
hostname and what command did you use to find this out?

lab68> hostname --fqdn
lab68.net.cecs.csulb.edu


5) What is the hardware (ethernet) address of your machine?

lab68> ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:22:4d:4c:79:03 
...

the hardware address is:
HWaddr 00:22:4d:4c:79:03


6) What does it use for its broadcast address?

lab68> ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:22:4d:4c:79:03  
          inet addr:134.139.248.68  Bcast:134.139.248.95  Mask:255.255.255.224

Bcast:134.139.248.95


7) The routing table for your machine contains one gateway entry. What is that entry?

lab68> route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
134.139.248.64  *               255.255.255.224 U     0      0        0 eth0
loopback        *               255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
default         jaguar.net.cecs 0.0.0.0         UG    1      0        0 eth0


8) What netmask does the loopback interface use?

255.0.0.0 (See above)

Question about arp. Ping two other of the lab machines.
9) What entries are in the arp table? Give the full entries including the hardware addresses.

arp -n
Address			HWtype	HWaddress		Flags Mask		Iface
134.139.248.65		ether	00:a0:cc:29:d0:70	C			eth0
134.139.248.67		ether	00:22:4d:4c:79:82	C			eth0


Questions about the resolver. Examine /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/nsswitch.conf; read the manual
entry for resolv.conf.
10) What methods (NIS, DNS/bind, hosts file) does your machine use to locate a hostname and in what
order?

In /etc/nsswitch:
hosts: files dns


11) What other machine does your machine use for DNS (resolver)?

In /etc/resolv.conf:
nameserver 134.139.248.17

12) Your machine allows certain other machines to be accessed without typing the entire (fully qualified)
host name. Which hostnames can be accessed using this shorthand.

*.net.cecs.csulb.edu
*.cecs.csulb.edu
*.ics.uci.edu


Questions about the route table on panther.
13) What two gateways (routers) does panther know about?

csa476u1@panther:~$ /sbin/route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
134.139.248.16  *               255.255.255.240 U     0      0        0 eth0
localnet        jaguar.net.cecs 255.255.255.224 UG    0      0        0 eth0
134.139.248.64  jaguar.net.cecs 255.255.255.224 UG    0      0        0 eth0
loopback        *               255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
default         cheetah.cecs.cs 0.0.0.0         UG    1      0        0 eth0

jaguar.net.cecs and cheetah.cecs.cs

14) What route entry on panther allows panther to talk to the machine you administer? Hint: what
network address and subnet mask is your machine part of?

134.139.248.64

255.255.255.224


Question about netmasks.
15) A machine has internet number 134.139.43.56 and netmask 255.255.255.0; give its subnet
number (network name) and subnet broadcast address.

The subnet number is 0 and the subnet broadcast address is 255.

16) A machine has internet number 134.139.201.134 and netmask 255.255.255.224; give its subnet
number (network name) and subnet broadcast address.

The subnet number is 128 and the subnet broadcast address is 159.
