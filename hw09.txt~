CECS 476 Assignment 9 Spring 2015
This assignment covers the X Window system.
Examine the manual entry for the configuration file (xorg.conf).
1) What configuration option diables the action of the control-alt-backspace combination.

The configuration option ' DontZap ' can be used to disable contrl-alt-backspace from stopping the server.

In /etc/X11:
Examine the xorg.conf-vesa configuration file. The manual entry for xorg.conf will also be helpful.
2)

2a) How many different mouse protocol options available?

# The available mouse protocols types that you can set below are:
#    Auto BusMouse GlidePoint GlidePointPS/2 IntelliMouse IMPS/2
#    Logitech Microsoft MMHitTab MMSeries Mouseman MouseManPlusPS/2
#    MouseSystems NetMousePS/2 NetScrollPS/2 OSMouse PS/2 SysMouse
#    ThinkingMouse ThinkingMousePS/2 Xqueue

21 protocol options

2b) If this file were to be used, what protocol option would be used for the mouse?

PS/2

Examine the initializations for xinit.
2c) How is the default window manager set (use ls)?
Verify this by starting X as bob (use the startx command).

-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  894 Feb 27  2011 xinitrc.wmaker*

In xinitrc.wmaker:

# Start the window manager:
if [ -z "$DESKTOP_SESSION" -a -x /usr/bin/ck-launch-session ]; then
  exec ck-launch-session /usr/bin/wmaker $NOCPP
else
  exec /usr/bin/wmaker $NOCPP
fi


In the log directory:
Examine the Xorg.0.log file (It was created when you started X in question 2.)
3a) What mouse input device was found?

vim /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[186503.458] (II) config/udev: Adding input device Logitech USB Optical Mouse (/dev/input/event4)

3b) What is the best Modeline supported by the video chipset (DCC)?

[186502.943] (II) intel(0): Printing DDC gathered Modelines:
[186502.943] (II) intel(0): Modeline "1280x1024"x0.0  108.00  1280 1328 1440 1688  1024 1025 1028 1066 +hsync +vsync (64.0 kHz)
[186502.943] (II) intel(0): Modeline "1280x1024"x0.0  135.00  1280 1296 1440 1688  1024 1025 1028 1066 +hsync +vsync (80.0 kHz)

3c) What is the best Modeline supported by the monitor (VGA1)?

[186502.943] (II) intel(0): Printing probed modes for output VGA1
[186502.943] (II) intel(0): Modeline "1280x1024"x60.0  108.00  1280 1328 1440 1688  1024 1025 1028 1066 +hsync +vsync (64.0 kHz)
[186502.943] (II) intel(0): Modeline "1280x1024"x75.0  135.00  1280 1296 1440 1688  1024 1025 1028 1066 +hsync +vsync (80.0 kHz)

Examine the device file system (use ls):
4) What device does /dev/mouse link to?
ls -al

lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root          10 Feb 24 06:31 mouse -> input/mice

In the djv account home directory:
Examine the .xinitrc:
5a) What window manager is used by this account?

twm

5b) How many windows are display when this account starts X?

xterm -n "xterm" -g 80x56-0+0 \#+420+764 -sb -sl 300 &
xterm -n "xterms" -g 80x24+0+0 \#+168+846 -sb -sl 300 &
xterm -n "xterm2" -g 80x24+0-0 -sb -sl 300 &

Examine the .twmrc:
A button has been set up that raises a window (to be on top of the other windows).
5c) Report the button and the line that does it?

In .twmrc:

"F3"    =      : window : f.function "raise-n-focus"
"F3"    =      : title  : f.function "raise-n-focus"

On your system as administrator:
Modify the default fvwm settings to automatically start two 80x24 xterm windows in the upper left and
lower right of the screen. Also modify the settings so the background is solid yellow.
6a) Report the name of the file and the modifications you made to that file?

In .xinitrc:
xsetroot -solid yellow
xterm -n "xterm1" -g 80x24+0+0 -sb -sl 300
xterm -n "xterm2" -g 80x24+1000+1000 -sb -sl 300

Modify the default window manager to be twm.
Verify this works by starting X as bob.
6b) How did you do this?

Copy the .xinitrc into bob and change ownership so it can be edited:

root@lab68:/etc/X11/xinit# cp ~djv/.xinitrc ~bob/
root@lab68:/etc/X11/xinit# chown 777 ~bob/.xinitrc 
root@lab68:/etc/X11/xinit# chown bob.cecsu ~bob/.xinitrc

Make twm the windows manager:

xsetroot -solid blue
xterm -n "xterm" -g 80x56-0+0 \#+420+764 -sb -sl 300 &
xterm -n "xterms" -g 80x24+0+0 \#+168+846 -sb -sl 300 &
xterm -n "xterm2" -g 80x24+0-0 -sb -sl 300 &
twm
#fvwm2

Use twm instead of fvwm2 in .xinitrc

Run the xvidtune program.
7a) What are the horizontal and vertical display resolutions? (HDisplay, VDisplay)

1280x1024

7b) What is the vertical synchonization rate?

1025

On your system as sue:
Modify sue's account so it (a) uses twm as the window manager instead of the default manager (b)
automatically starts an xterm in the upper left and (c) sets the background to solid red.
Verify by starting X as sue.
8) Report the name of the file you created and the contents of that file.

xsetroot -solid yellow
xterm -n "xterm" -g 80x56+0+0 \#+420+764 -sb -sl 300 &
twm
#fvwm2
