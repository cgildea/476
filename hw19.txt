This project is about configuring mail.
1) As bob modify your incoming mail handling as follows (you'll need to create a .procmailrc file if it
doesn't exist):
a) If the Subject line contains the word "Late" place the mail in a file called latestuff.
b) If it is from csa476xx (use your account here) place the mail in a file called importantstuff
c) If the body of the mail contains the word Bargain place the mail in a file called junkmail
If an incoming mail matches multiple actions, the first actions specified should be taken. Use lockfiles in all
cases.
Report: the contents of bob's .procmailrc

in .procmailrc:
:0:late
* ^Subject.*Late*
$HOME/Inbox/latestuff

:0:important
* ^From:csa476u1
$HOME/Inbox/importantstuff

:0:junk B:
*Bargain*
$HOME/Inbox/junkmail


For the next question, examine the sendmail.cf file on your machine. (If you have changed yours, you
may examine the one on panther.)
2) Report the number of the ruleset that converts header names to masqueraded form.

in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
###################################################################
###  Ruleset 93 -- convert header names to masqueraded form     ###
###################################################################

SMasqHdr=93


For the next question use the manual and possibly some additional commands.
3) Report the name and full path name of the pop3 server.

In /etc/inetd.conf
# Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) server:
#pop3    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/popa3d


Make a copy of the standard slackware mc macros. (/usr/share/sendmail/cf/cf) Modify the copy of the
macros so jaguar is setup as being the "smart host" for your machine. Modify the copy of the macros so
jaguar is setup as being the "mail hub" for your machine. Build the macros into a cf (Build), install the
cf as the new mail configuration, restart sendmail.
Modify the new sendmail configuration so that mail for bob and root is to be delivered locally and not to
the mail hub.
Test the mail hub change by (from root) sending mail to your csa account (should be reabable on jaguar)
and to bob (should be readable on your machine) with no @ signs.
Test the smart host change by (from root) sending mail to your csa account @panther (should be readable
on panther and the log on your machine should say "relay = jaguar.net.cecs.csulb.edu").

4) Report the changes you made to the macros.



5) Report: the change you made to the cf (the special case stuff for bob and root).
