Questions 1 and 2 cover SUID programs. While doing questions 1 and 2 you should NOT be root.
You must pay particular attention to which user you are when doing the parts of this project. Be sure you
are the user you are instructed to be at each step of the project.
As bob: get a copy of ~djv/clogit.c and compile it (gcc something.c -o binaryfile). Name the compiled
version clogit. Don’t forget to look at it to see what it does. Create a file called datelog to be mode 600
and change the clogit command to be SUID and executable by everyone (mode 4711).
Login as your account: run clogit.

bob@lab68:~> cp ~djv/clogit.c .
bob@lab68:~> gcc clogit.c -o clogit
bob@lab68:~> vim datelog.txt       
bob@lab68:~> chmod 600 datelog.txt
bob@lab68:~> chmod 4711 clogit
csa476u1@lab68:~$ ~bob/./clogit

1) Report: the last two lines in the datelog


In ~bob/datelog:
csa476u1  Thu Apr 23 14:51:26 2015


Verify security: try doing the same thing by creating (as bob) a shell script that writes to the file using
”echo” commands. (Don’t be particular about the exact things you echo.) Make the shell script SUID.
Login as your account: run the shell script.
2) Report: what happens.


bash: /home/bob/./test.sh: Permission denied.



Examine the login.defs file on your machine.
If you want to enable time restrictions on logins, a variable needs to be set and a file needs to be modified.
3) Report the variable and the file name.

In /etc/login.defs:
PORTIME_CHECKS_ENAB 	yes

File that needs to be modified:
/etc/porttime

If a home directory for a user cannot be found when that user attempts to login, the user may or may not
be allowed to complete the login 
4) Report the name of the variable that controls this behavior

DEFAULT_HOME	yes

Make (and test) the following modifications to your login.defs file:

a) Log all su activity

In /etc/login.defs:
SYSLOG_SU_ENAB	yes
SULOG_File	/var/log/sulog


b) Limit su to root to be from the wheel only. To test this, add bob to the wheel group (gid 10), but do
not add your account, make sure bob can su and you cannot.

5) Report: the changes you made and the last line of your su log.

In /etc/group: 
wheel:x:10:root,bob
usermod -G wheel bob

In /etc/login.defs:
SU_WHEEL_ONLY	yes


csa476u1@lab68:~$ su -
You are not authorized to su root 

In /var/log/sulog:
SU 04/23 15:31 + /dev/tty1 bob-root

On cheetah examine the login history.
6) Report: Ignoring your account, who where the last 3 logins, to what accounts, what hours were they on
and where did they login from.

Use iptables to block ssh into your machine from panther only. To test this, try to ssh into your machine
from both panther and cougar.
7) Report: The command you issued.

iptables -A INPUT -s 134.139.248.21 -j DROP

iptables --flush


Clean up: flush all iptables entries.
On cheetah, examine /usr/local/bin/iptables-rules.sh to see cheetah’s firewall rules.
8) Report: What rule allows established inbound connections (it differs slightly from the lecture notes).

In /usr/local/bin/iptables-rules.sh:
$IPT -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
