Purpose: This part of the assignment covers init.
Submission: You will submit with “˜grader/submit 07”. You will also provide a “demonstration”.
You want to attach a terminal to serial port 0 (DOS calls this COM1). (1) Report: What line would you
need to change in the inittab. (Do not make this change, just report the line that would need to be
changed.)

s0:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -L ttyS0 9600 vt100

The following must be done from CONSOLE (at the keyboard of your machine):
Modify your inittab so that control-alt-delete does not reboot the machine. Cause init to re-read
inittab. Check to make sure that your have successfully disabled control-alt-delete.
Good practice: never delete or modify a default configuration line, comment the old one out (so you can go
back to it) and add the new one.
Demonstration: call the instructor over and let him type control-alt-delete (your machine should not
reboot).
Cleanup: restore inittab to it’s original condition.
(2) Report: The exact text of the line that disables control-alt-delete. The command you ran to make that
line take effect

ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t5 -r now

Use init q in the console after saving the file to apply the changes

On shutdown, how many seconds does init wait before forcibly terminating processes? (Hint: man init)
3) Report: the number of seconds.

ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t5 -r now

init waits 5 seconds before using a kill -9 command on processes

This part of the assignment cron and at.
Cron: as bob; set up you crontab so that you run an ls command every minute (redirect the output of the
ls to a file).
4) Report: your crontab entry. Just the one line is ok.

* * * * * ls >> ~/lstemp.txt

At: as bob; Set up an at entry, that in 5 minutes from now will run the ls command. (Again, redirect the
output of the ls to a file.)
5) Report: the exact command you used to do this.

at> ls >> ~/ls2tmp.txt
