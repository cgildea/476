Purpose: This assignment covers backups and termcap.
Backups --
tar: Make a tar back up of the home directory of your user (bob) to your removable device (floppy or
flashdrive). Confirm that the backup was made using the t option.
Note: This is a tar device not a tar file. It does not have a directory structure, so no mkfs should be done;
all information on the device before the tar will be destroyed. After you do the backup, your device will
look like a tape.

1) Submit: the sequence of commands from login up through the tar command that lists the tar contents.
tar, extracting an archive: Login as root, this puts you in /root. Extract the contents of the
compressed tar file ~djv/giant.tgz, preserving the permissions. (Note, this should build a directory called
giant inside /root.)


root@lab68:/dev# tar -cf /dev/fd0 ~bob/
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
root@lab68:/dev# tar -tf /dev/fd0

home/bob/.xsession

root@lab68:~# tar -xpf ~djv/giant.tgz
root@lab68:~# ls
giant/

2) Submission: The exact command you used. Inside giant there are three subdirectories, submit: the
names of these three directories. (This lets me know you unwound the archive.) Pick any of these
subdirectories, you will find a file inside it, submit: the name of the file, who owns the file, what group the
file belongs to and the access rights (the rwx stuff) for the file. (This lets me know you preserved
permissions.)

root@lab68:~# cd giant/
root@lab68:~/giant# ls
fee/  fie/  foe/
root@lab68:~/giant# cd foe/
root@lab68:~/giant/foe# ls -al
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 djv faculty 4096 Feb 23  1998 ./
drwxr-xr-x 5 djv faculty 4096 Feb 23  1998 ../
-rw-r--r-- 1 djv faculty   10 Feb 23  1998 fum

Name: fum
Owner: djv
Group: faculty
Access Rights: -rw-r--r-- 

As root, extract the contents of the compressed tar file ~djv/house.txz, preserving the permissions.
(Note, this should build a directory called house inside /root.)

3) Submission: The exact command you used. The contents of the file called wolf.

root@lab68:~# tar -xpf ~djv/house.txz
root@lab68:~# ls
giant/  house/ 
root@lab68:~# cd house/
root@lab68:~/house# ls
bricks/  sticks/  straw/
root@lab68:~/house/bricks# cat wolf 
Huff and puff

Encryption: The file is encrypted using gpg with the passphrase troll. Decrypt the file ~djv/joe.cr.
4) Submit: the contents of the file.

root@lab68:~/house/bricks# gpg -d ~djv/joe.cr 
gpg: directory `/root/.gnupg' created
gpg: new configuration file `/root/.gnupg/gpg.conf' created
gpg: WARNING: options in `/root/.gnupg/gpg.conf' are not yet active during this run

Hi there joe

Terminals --
5) Termcap. On the linux console: what sequence is used to start underlining?

root@lab68:~# man termcap | grep underlin
       ms   Cursor movement works in standout/underline mode
       ul   Terminal underlines although it can not overstrike
       ue   End underlining
       us   Start underlining

us is used to start underlining
In /etc/termcap:
:us=\E[1m

6) stty. On the linux console: what key is used to stop (pause) the output to the screen? What command
would you give to define control-Y to be the key used to stop the output?

stop CHAR
   CHAR will stop the output

From stty -a:
stop = ^S;

stty stop ^Y will set the stop the output to the screen
