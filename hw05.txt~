Purpose: This assignment covers disk and file system administration.
Submission: You will submit hw05.txt using “˜grader/submit 05” as before. Your instructor will also test
your configurations while grading.
1) On the machine you administer there is a second drive. It should be sdb, if you don’t locate such a disk
let the instructor know.

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!

Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.

Run fdisk on sdb. Remove all existing partitions and create two partitions. The first partition should use
about 10 percent of the disk, and the second partition should contain the remainder. Change the type of
the first partition to linux swap. (You can have fdisk give you a list of partition codes that it uses.)
While running fdisk make sure the second parition you created is marked as “linux native” or “linux”,
this is almost always the default when you make a partition, but it is always worth checking when using a
version of fdisk you haven’t used before. Save your partition table.
Run mke2fs to build an ext2 file system on the second disk partition (the large one) and attach that file
system as /newdisk. Be careful not to modify (or damage) your main drive which is sda or you will
destroy your system.
Now mount the file system you just created by hand (this is the safest way to make sure it is set up right).
Submit: 1a) a brief description what you did with fdisk and a listing of your partition table. 1b) the exact
form of the mount command you used and the disk free df report on the new file system.


1b)
root@lab68:/dev# mke2fs sdb2
root@lab68:/dev# mkdir /newdrive
root@lab68:/dev# mount -w /dev/sdb2 /newdrive

root@lab68:/dev# df -h /newdrive/
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdb2        25G   44M   24G   1% /newdrive

2) Modify your system so that the mount will occur automatically at boot. Test this by rebooting the
machine.
Submit: the line you added to your fstab.

root@lab68:/dev# vim /etc/fstab
--I added this line into the fstab file:
/dev/sdb2        /newmount        ext2        defaults         1   1

root@lab68:~# df -h /newdisk/
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdb2        25G   44M   24G   1% /newdisk


3) You will need a floppy disk or flashdrive for questions 3 and 4. Set-up an ext2 file system on this device
(similar process to setting up second disk); Make an entry in fstab that allows any user to insert and
mount an ext2 floppy/flashdrive using /mnt/extdisk as the mount point. Change the permissions on
/mnt/extdisk to 777 (chmod 777 /mnt/extdisk). Login as bob (not root), plug in your ext2 device,
mount it, copy a file to the device, unmount and remove the device.
Submit: the line you entered into fstab and the exact mount command you used.

root@lab68:/dev# mke2fs fd0
root@lab68:/dev# mkdir /mnt/extdisk
root@lab68:/dev# mount -w /dev/fd0 /mnt/extdisk
root@lab68:/dev# vim /etc/fstab
--I added this line into the fstab file:
/dev/fd0        /mnt/extdisk        ext2        user         0   0
root@lab68:/dev# chmod 777 /mnt/extdisk

4) As the system administrator: run an fsck on your device. Remember: Unix/Linux usually wants the file
system being checked to be unmounted, so it is not changing while the check is performed. If the file
system is clean you may need to force a check (-f option) to see one actually occur.
Submit: the exact command you used and summarize what the command output.

root@lab68:/dev# umount /dev/fd0
root@lab68:/dev# fsck /dev/fd0
fsck from util-linux 2.19
e2fsck 1.41.14 (22-Dec-2010)
/dev/fd0: clean, 23/184 files, 55/1440 blocks

root@lab68:/dev# chmod 755 /mnt


Clean up: Change the permissions on /mnt back to 755. Unmount the device before removing and
returning it. Leave the hard drive mounted, leave the fstab for the instructor to examine.
