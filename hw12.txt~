1) This project is about configuring a machine to be on the network.
Before starting this project, ask the instructor to disable networking on your machine. He will have to
reboot to do this.

Get you machine up and onto the network. Do this by typing commands in one at a time, not by running a
script. You will not enable all of networking, just enough to be able to ping 127.0.0.1, 134.139.248.65,
134.139.248.33 and 134.139.248.17. To do this you need to get the interface and route tables up.
The hostname, internet address, gateway and netmask of your machine are on the label on the front. The
cable number for your machine is its address with the host part set to all zeros. The broadcast address for
your machine is its address with the host part set to all ones. You should test to ensure your machine is
connected to the network.
Report: the exact sequence of commands you used to connect your machine to the network.

Inside /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1:

/sbin/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1

/sbin/route add -net 127.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 lo

ifconfig eth0 134.139.248.68 netmask 255.255.255.224

route add default gw 134.139.248.65

ping 127.0.0.1 - Good
ping 134.139.248.68 - Good
ping 134.139.248.65 - Good
ping 134.139.248.17 - Good
ping puma - Good
ping prep.ai.mit.edu - Good



Clean up: to re-enable default networking you must change the mode of the network initialization files used
by init. Type the following command:
chmod a+x /etc/rc.d/rc.inet*


Now when you reboot init will bring the network up automatically.

2) Resolver/DNS. The commands nslookup web-main and nslookup columbo fail because the full names
of the machines are web-main.ics.uci.edu and columbo.ics.uci.edu. Fix your machine so that
nslookup web-main works (as well as using the "first-name" of all other machines ending in
ics.uci.edu). Sanity check, make sure nslookup still works for panther and cheetah

Add ics.uci.edu to the search

3) Using the inetd.conf, disable telnets into your machine.


Report: What did you do to the file.
Cleanup: reenable telnets.



4) Using the tcp wrappers, deny telnets from panther. (Be sure to test that they are still allowed from
other machines.) The manual entry for this question is hosts_access from section 5.


Report: Which file did you use and what did you put into it.


Cleanup: reenable telnets.



5) Report: List the names of the remote programs available on jaguar. (List each name just once).



6) Allow csa476xx (your account) on panther to rlogin as bob on the machine you administer without a
password.
Report: Which file did you use, on which machine, and what did you put into it.



7) Allow any user from cougar to rlogin to the machine you administer without a password. That is, if
they are joe on cougar, they are allowed to rlogin as joe on your machine without a password. Of course
joe must be a user that exists. Check this out by using your csa476xx account (because it is the only
account you have access to that exists on both machines).
Report: Which file did you use, on which machine, and what did you put into it.



8) Allow csa476xx (your account) on panther to ssh to bob on the machine you administer without a
password.
Report: the steps you took to allow this.
